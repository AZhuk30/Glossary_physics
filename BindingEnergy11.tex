name=Binding energy of nuclear particles,
    description={The mass of a particle (atom, proton, etc.) increase with the "binding energy" of it's component particles. Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to split a nucleus of an atom into its component protons and neutrons, or, collectively, the nucleons. The binding energy of nuclei is always a positive number, since all nuclei require net energy to separate them into individual protons and neutrons.
