{
name=Alpha Decay,
    description={Alpha decay ($\alpha$-decay) is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into an atom with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two.  An example is the decay of Po-210 to helium and Pb-206}
