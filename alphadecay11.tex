{name=alpha decay,description={Alpha decay or $/alpha$-decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into an atom with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two. Consider the example of Po - 210 decaying by the emission of an alpha particle to Helium and Pb - 206.}}
