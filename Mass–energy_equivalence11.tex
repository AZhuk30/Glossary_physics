    name=Mass–energy equivalence,
    description={Mass–energy equivalence is a concept formulated by Albert Einstein that explains the relationship between mass and energy. It states every mass has an energy equivalent and vice versa—expressed using the formula:

$$E = mc^2$$

$E$ - the energy of a physical system \\
$m$ - the mass of the system\\
$c$ - the speed of light in a vacuum\\

Because the speed of light is a very large number in everyday units, the formula implies that any small amount of matter contains a very large amount of energy.

Some of this energy may be released as heat and light by nuclear transformations. This also serves to convert units of mass to units of energy, no matter what system of measurement units used}
